# About

*img of project in action*

A light weight single page app designed to simplify the viewing of hydrometric data in canada.

Cascade is a web application written in react with a simple .net mvc controller server for data fetching from an api that samples [Environment Canadas hydrometric data](https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/mainmenu/real_time_data_index_e.html). It displays this data in a more digestible format using a dashboard style view, that allows the user to view multiple rivers water levels at the same time.

Cascade was built as a learning project to practice react and provide myself and other river users with a tool they could use to view data easier and more conviently
